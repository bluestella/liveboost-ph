# Launching Live Selling: A 7-Day Playbook

Live selling works best when it’s treated like a repeatable system—not a one-off event.

## Day 1: Define the offer

- Pick 10–20 SKUs you can confidently fulfill
- Decide the hero offer (bundle, discount, or bonus)
- Write your “why now” line

## Day 2: Build the run-of-show

Use a simple structure:

1. Hook + social proof
2. Product demo
3. Objection handling
4. CTA + urgency

## Day 3: Script the conversions

Write short prompts for:

- Price anchoring
- Scarcity (inventory, limited bonuses)
- Alternative options for different budgets

## Day 4: Production checklist

Audio, lighting, framing, and a backup plan.

## Day 5: Rehearse

Run a 30-minute practice session and capture timing notes.

## Day 6: Go live

Track 3 metrics:

- Viewers → clicks
- Clicks → checkout
- Checkout → purchases

## Day 7: Review + iterate

Keep what converts, remove what doesn’t, and double down on pacing.
