# Marketplace Live Selling Metrics That Matter

Most dashboards overwhelm you with numbers. You only need a few to run a tight loop.

## 1) Audience quality

Are the right people showing up?

- Follower growth
- Returning viewers
- Average watch time

## 2) Click intent

Can you turn attention into product-page visits?

- Product clicks per minute
- CTR on pinned products

## 3) Checkout efficiency

Where does the funnel break?

- Add-to-cart rate
- Checkout completion rate

## 4) Sales output

The results that matter:

- GMV per session
- Units sold per SKU
- AOV

## A simple cadence

- Weekly: review top SKUs and hooks
- Per session: note objections and winning CTAs
- Monthly: refine the product mix
